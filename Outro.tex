\textit{Hello world! This is a comprehensive recap of the Computer Vision course held by Prof. Conci at the University of Trento. The document covers pretty much all the topics discussed in class and it's a great source to prepare for the exam, the order of the topics is structured in a way that follows the course's progression. Although we put as much love and care as we could there might still be some mistakes or inaccuracies, so feel free to contact us. We hope you find our work useful, and we wish you the best of luck for the exam! ;)}
